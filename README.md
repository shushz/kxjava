# Kickables

Kickables (KX) are a state management abstraction targeted at very high scale, concurrent applications.

These abstractions are heavily influenced by RX for their APIs, but, unlike RX, are designed with state management goal in mind.

Kickables are lazy, provide powerful, dependency-aware caching and support efficient automatic invalidation.

They are heavily oriented at performance and simplicity of use.

This is a Java language implementation of this concept.
